Turn your text into flaming in wordpress!

== Description ==
This plugin provides text to logo features such as FlamingText,
Dripping Blood, Chrome, etc. It is the easiest way to use the power of
FlamingText to enhance your blog entries.

This plug adds a button to the WYSIWYG. Once clicked, an inline popup will
allow users to define different parameters (eg. logo style, font, size, color)
to design their own logo based on what they type. When the users are happy
with their creation, they can click OK and the image is inserted directly into
your post.

== Installation ==

###Installing The Plugin###

Visit plugins settings and then choose add new, and then upload the ZIP file -
need ftp serveice turned on for doing so.

Alternatively, extract all files from the ZIP file, **making sure to keep the file structure
intact**, and then upload it to `/wp-content/plugins/`. This should result in
multiple subfolders and files.

Then just visit your admin area and activate the plugin.

== Upcoming changes ==
User can create an account through the plugin to get extra features from
